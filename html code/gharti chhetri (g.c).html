        <h1><center>GHARTI CHHETRI (G.C)</center></h1>
        <font size="4">The Gharti, (or Bhujel) are considered an offshoot of the Indian Chettri who, due to poverty, served royal families and nobles as bonded laborers, palanquin-bearers (an enclosed litter), and water-carriers. Traditionally, the men were palanquin-bearers and the women water-carriers, but today most labor on farms. Vermilion and a bead necklace are the symbols of married women. The services of a Brahmin are sought for performing birth, marriage and death rituals. They worship deities such as Kali, Lakshmi and Kanchyaga.<br></font>

            Historically, surnames evolved as a way to sort people into groups - by occupation, place of origin, clan affiliation, patronage, parentage, adoption, and even physical characteristics (like red hair). Many of the modern surnames in the dictionary can be traced back to Britain and Ireland.
