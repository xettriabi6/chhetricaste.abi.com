        <p>The Khadkas are a clan in Nepal & India. They are Proper Hindu. Khadkas are from Kshtriya and Magar cast. But only chhetri Khadka are respected with title Kaji. Mostly Khadkas are from Chhetri caste but there are few Khadkas with Magar caste. Previously before Drabya bikram shah king of Gorkha, khadka used to be king of Kalikot and Gorkha. Before that they used to be great warriors fighting near sukantamaliyena valley of parsuanamarugam near sindhwali to save the valleys kingdom with their traditional weapon called Khadga, which also formed the word Khadka. This is rarely known to people about the fighters of Sukantamaliyena, which was related to Indiana zones at a very ancient time. Therefore, today there some khadka with Kalikote. According to different records there are 47 types of khadka with 12 different Gotra. Some of Khadkas are also found in Darjeeling, Sikkim, Bhutan, etc.

            <br><br>There are many believes regarding where the name khadka was derived. But the famous and most trust worthy believe is; Khadka caste was taken from Khadga. Khadga means a weapon just like a sword. Later the term khadga changes into Khadka. So Khadka means man with a sword. This saying is implemented in both Khadkas (Chhetri and Magar).
